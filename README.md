# T-shirt-scrape-FLIPKART_D2C
A webscraper code implemented using beautifulSoup which scrapes the Flipkart Fashion website of tshirts category and 
tries to collect information of 400 tshirts (Price, stars, reviews, Fabric, Pattern etc) and stores them as a CSV items.

The code can be easily scaled to various other product categories like Pants, Skirts etc.
This methodology can also be scaled to other similar websites like Nordstrom/Myntra etc to get an idea of what products are currently
working in the market and predict future trends based on current ones.
